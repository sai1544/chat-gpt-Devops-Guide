📝 DevOps FastAPI Project — Day 1 & Day 2 Notes
 
 
---
 
📅 Day 1 — FastAPI + Docker Fundamentals
 
FastAPI Setup
 
Initialized minimal FastAPI project
 
Implemented /health endpoint
 
Tested locally via Uvicorn
 
 
Command:
 
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
 
 
---
 
Local Debugging Concepts
 
Understood app.main:app import path
 
Observed stack traces for debugging
 
Verified logs from terminal
 
 
 
---
 
Dockerization
 
Created Dockerfile with:
 
python:3.10-slim base image
 
Installed dependencies from requirements.txt
 
Copied application code
 
Set Uvicorn as entrypoint
 
 
 
Image Build:
 
docker build -t fastapi-app .
 
Run Container:
 
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
 
 
---
 
Verification
 
Accessed service from EC2 public IP:
 
 
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8000/health
 
Verified container logs using:
 
 
docker logs <container-id>

📅 Day 2 — Logging + Config + PostgreSQL Integration
 
Project Structure Refactor
 
Refactored into modular architecture:
 
app/
  routes/
  core/
  db/
  utils/
 
 
---
 
Structured Logging
 
Implemented reusable logger via logging module
 
Logged startup events
 
Logs written to stdout (container friendly)
 
 
 
---
 
Environment-Based Configuration
 
Created core/config.py
 
Loaded DB configs via os.getenv()
 
Removed DB credentials from codebase
 
 
Example env keys:
 
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_NAME
DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD
 
 
---
 
PostgreSQL Integration (psycopg2)
 
Installed psycopg2-binary
 
Created DB connector:
 
get_db_connection()
 
 
Wrote helper functions:
 
insert_service_status()
 
fetch_latest_status()
 
 
 
 
---
 
Database Schema
 
Table created:
 
CREATE TABLE service_status (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  service_name VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
 
 
---
 
Fail-Fast Startup Logic
 
DB connection checked on startup event
 
If DB unavailable → application exits
 
Ensures no degraded operation
 
 
Flow:
 
App start → DB check → success OR crash
 
 
---
 
Docker Compose Orchestration
 
Created docker-compose.yml with:
 
db service (PostgreSQL)
 
app service (FastAPI)
 
 
Internal networking:
 
DB_HOST=db
 
Run:
 
docker-compose up --build
 
 
---
 
🧠 Core Concepts Learned
 
Containerization
 
Dockerfile
 
Image vs Container
 
Port mapping
 
Logs to stdout
 
 
Config & Secrets
 
Env vars replace hardcoding
 
12-factor config principle
 
 
DB Connectivity
 
psycopg2 usage
 
SQL inserts & reads
 
Connection lifecycle
 
 
Fail-Fast Architecture
 
Detect critical failures early
 
Break instead of running broken
 
 
Service Orchestration
 
Docker Compose networking
 
Internal DNS resolution
 
depends_on behavior
 
 
 
---
 
🎤 Interview Highlights
 
You can say:
 
Built containerized FastAPI service
 
Implemented health endpoint & structured logging
 
Externalized configuration using env vars
 
Verified PostgreSQL connectivity with psycopg2
 
Applied fail-fast startup checks
 
Used Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
 
 
 
---
 
🎯 End State After Day 2
 
You now have: ✔ Containerized FastAPI App
✔ Logging system
✔ Env-driven config system
✔ PostgreSQL integration
✔ Fail-fast startup behavior
✔ Docker Compose orchestration
